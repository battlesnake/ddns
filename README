Title: 	ddns-update

Description:
	Script to provide dynamic DNS for a subdomain that you own, which uses
	PowerDNS to run its nameserver.
	Optional web interface included.

Author:
	Mark K Cowan, mark@battlesnake.co.uk

Requires:
	PowerDNS (with MySQL backend), MySQL, bash, optional:web server+PHP

Installation:
	Create a database user for the script to use and grant the necessary
	permissions (select/update/insert/delete) to the user, for the powerdns
	database.  The script should be run from the server which hosts the
	PowerDNS MySQL database.  If you wish to run it from elsewhere, modify
	the script as needed.
	The web interface is optional, and should be considered insecure and
	a liability.
